Steps to Run the "Developing and Implementing a Graph Database System for Efficient and Scalable Healthcare Records Management" Project

Step 1: Check if Node.js is Installed

	Open Command Prompt (CMD) or Terminal on your device.

	Type the following command and press Enter:

		node -v

	If it shows a version number (e.g., v16.20.0), Node.js is already installed. Skip to "Step 4".

	If it shows an error or is not recognized, follow the steps below to install Node.js.


Step 2: Install Node.js

	Go to the official Node.js website: 'https://nodejs.org/'.

	Download the LTS version.

	Run the installer and follow the instructions:

	Accept the license agreement.

	Ensure the Add to PATH option is checked.

	Click Install and wait for it to finish.


Step 3: Verify Installation

	Open CMD/Terminal and type:

		node -v

	This will display the Node.js version if successfully installed.

	Also, check npm (Node Package Manager) by typing:

		npm -v

	This will display the npm version.


Step 4: Run the Project

	Navigate to the project folder:

		cd "Developing and Implementing a Graph Database System for Efficient and Scalable Healthcare Records Management"

	Start the server by typing:

		node server.js

	If successful, youâ€™ll see the message:

	Server is running on http://localhost:3000

	Open the link:

	Press Ctrl + Left Click on the URL in CMD, and it will open in your browser.

	To stop the server:

	In the same CMD window, press
